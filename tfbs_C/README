Data files
- *_11111111.txt - transcription factor file for a particular transcription factor.  Each possible 8-mer is present in exactly one row; the total # rows is 1/2 of 4**8 because complimentary sequences have the same behavior and thus appear on the same line.
- *.asc - a DNA sequence file from an enhancer region of interest

Programs
- tf8merFilter.cpp - retain only 8mers with a high enough e-score (default 0.3)
./tf8merFilter 0.3 < TF_8MER_FILE.tsv > output.tsv
8-mer	8-mer	E-score	Median	Z-score
AAAAAAAA	TTTTTTTT	0.24584	29514.79	0.5820

- tf8merAlign.cpp - align 8mers from a list against a sequence
./tf8merAlign SEQ_FILE.txt < TF_8MERS_.tsv

- test.sh - runs the above programs on one of the example files


Brute force Mutation -
(1) search for mutations of sequence file so that there are no binding sites with at least 3 8mer matches in a row
(2) do the same but also while trying to preserve binding sites for a second (or more) transcription factors
